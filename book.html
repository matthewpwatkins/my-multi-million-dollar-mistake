Mistake</h1>
<h2 id="what-i-wish-i-knew-about-finances-as-a-young-adult">What I Wish
I Knew About Finances as a Young Adult</h2>
<h1 id="why-im-writing-this-why-im-writing-this">Why I’m Writing This
{#why-i’m-writing-this}</h1>
<p>I served a 2-year full-time mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints right after high school. I returned at 21 years old,
married my wife a few months later, and together we started in the world
of “adulting.”</p>
<p>Financially, I thought I had it all figured out. My wife and I had
both been taught about the dangers of debt and excessive consumption. We
had worked hard before we married, and were blessed to start married
life with a few thousand dollars in the bank!</p>
<p>We lived frugally, squeezing every penny. We did all the
<em>hard</em> work to create financial success. But we didn’t do the
<em>easy</em> work. And that’s where it all went wrong.</p>
<p>When my dad tried to wakeboard for the first time, he just couldn’t
get it. Everyone tried to tell him “when the boat starts going fast
enough, just stand up!” But every time he “<em>just</em> stood up,” he
fell ungracefully into the water. He felt embarrassed and defeated.
Finally, one of his friends said “Keith, here’s the science of what’s
going on,” and explained the physics of <em>how</em> wakeboarding works.
Once he explained the physics, Dad didn’t feel he was blindly following
instructions (“<em>just</em> stand up”). He was able to wakeboard after
that. He could intuit <em>what</em> to do because he now understood the
<em>how</em>.</p>
<p>My brain works the same way. My risk-averse, analytical mind needed
the same explanation for finance that my dad received for wakeboarding.
None of this “<em>just</em> open a Roth IRA” stuff. I needed someone to
explain “here’s how the financial world works and <em>why</em> this is
the right way.”</p>
<p>I wish I could go back in time and have a 3-hour visit with my
21-year old self and teach him what I’m writing here. That 3-hour
discussion would have changed my entire financial life. The <em>level of
effort</em> I would have expended through that first decade would have
been exactly the same. But simply changing the <em>direction</em> of
that effort would have put me hundreds of thousands of dollars ahead of
where I’m at now (2025) and will have made <em>several million
dollars</em> of difference by the time I retire. That’s no typo.
<strong>One three-hour discussion would have saved me several million
dollars by the time I retire.</strong></p>
<p>I’m writing this because I know many young adults are like me. They
want to succeed financially, and they understand the basics of avoiding
debt, but they were never taught the principles of wealth-building. They
don’t know the <em>incredible</em> opportunities staring them in the
face. And by the time they learn these lessons in their 30s or 40s,
they, like me, will have missed out on the multi-million dollar
opportunities that were available only in their twenties.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-1:-the-eighth-wonder-of-the-world">Chapter 1: The eighth
wonder of the world</h1>
<h2 id="the-rich-uncle">The rich uncle</h2>
<p>Let’s play a game and see how human intuition plays out. Suppose a
rich uncle leaves you and your brother an inheritance in his will. His
estate will create a simple checking account for you and contribute
money into it every day for the next 4 years, after which, the money in
the account is yours. You can choose two different ways to earn:</p>
<p><strong>The $100/day plan:</strong> Very simple. His estate deposits
$100 into your account every day for the next 4 years.</p>
<p><strong>The 1% plan:</strong> Your account gets one dollar to start.
Then his estate increases the account value by 1% every day for the next
4 years.</p>
<p>The answer seems pretty clear: $100 per day for free, that’s
<em>awesome</em>! You and your brother both sign up. But to your horror,
you get too excited and accidentally sign up for the 1% plan!</p>
<p>You’re understandably bummed. Intuitively, this doesn’t sound
terribly exciting. 1% of your dollar is just a penny. Earn a penny a day
for four years, and you’ll have earned a whopping $14.61 in interest.
Meanwhile, your friends in Account B will have earned $146,100 during
those four years!</p>
<p>You’re feeling pretty bitter about this, so you track your account
balance over time so you can quantify just how much that mistaken button
click will cost you. Looking at the first two weeks, your depression is
completely justified:</p>

<p>As expected, you receive a penny into your account each day while
your brother is raking in <em>10,000x</em> that much every day. But I’ll
point you to Day 11 where you’ll see something weird there– you got an
extra cent on that day– a <em>whole extra cent</em>! That extra penny is
why I’m so excited for you choosing the 1% plan.</p>
<p><em>“So, I get an extra penny every week or two? So I won’t earn $13
over four years, maybe I’ll earn $16 or something? Not exactly a great
consolation prize.”</em></p>
<p>Look, I get this example underwhelming so far. But I want to show you
the power behind that extra penny. This tiny little example is your
first introduction to the eighth wonder of the world: <em>compound
growth</em>. That’s when the interest you earned earlier multiplies and
creates its own interest on top of itself. It’s like your money is
having babies!</p>
<p>Still not convinced? I get it. Let’s give it some time and check back
after a month:</p>
<table>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Okay, so another <em>three</em> “extra pennies” were added during the
final two weeks of the month. That’s nice, but you still don’t even have
enough to buy a Costco hotdog. Meanwhile while your insufferable brother
is apparently earning enough to pay his mortgage, and with cash to
spare!</p>
<p>Let’s check back after about 3 months:</p>
<table>

<td style="text-align: left;">$9,000.00</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In the past <em>90</em> days, you got <em>144</em> pennies– that’s
<em>54 extra pennies!</em> It’s encouraging to see a little increase in
the frequency of our “extra penny” phenomenon. But it doesn’t change the
vast overwhelm. Here we are 3 months out and you can’t even buy a value
menu burger from McDonalds. But your brother can now buy a decent used
car.</p>
<p>You’re getting really depressed. Let’s stop obsessing over this and
check back at the end of the year:</p>
<table>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Well it’s been a long year. Has your account blossomed into something
cool? Well, I think so! You expected a penny per day– a little over
$4.00 by this point, but you have almost $40! Those extra pennies are
coming in all the time now, not just every several days. Isn’t that
exciting?</p>
<p><em>“No, my brother has enough for a down payment on a new house,
while I still can’t even afford to take a date to get some decent
Mexican food!”</em></p>
<p>Understood. Let’s take a break for another year and check back
then.</p>

</tbody>

<p>Huh, that’s different! You had less than $40 after a year, you might
have expected $80 or so after 2 years– maybe a little more from those
“extra pennies.” But your account balance is now <em>18 times</em> that!
If you look at the day by day balance changes, you’ll find that you’re
not earning an occasional extra penny anymore– now you’re earning a
solid $12+ dollars <em>per day</em>. Cool!</p>
<p><em>“Yeah but $12/day is nothing compared to $100/day. We’re already
halfway through the 4 years and my brother is WAY ahead and I’m still
earning nowhere close to him. He’s getting rich and there’s no way I’ll
come close to catching up! Maybe he’ll have pity on me and invite me on
his nice vacation. Well, at least maybe I see it’s starting to grow
fast. Who knows, maybe it will grow to $5,000 by the time this is done.
Do I dare hope to see ten?”</em></p>
<p>Okay, okay, let’s check again after year 3.</p>

<p>Well your brother has crossed into six figures, and he’s gleefully
telling you all the things he’s going to do now that he’s “wealthy.” You
were maybe afraid to look at your own balance. You’re starting to
realize this interest rate thing is weird, so you don’t know what to
expect last year’s $1,400 grew into.</p>
<p>You open your account and you’re shocked to see you are almost
halfway to your brother’s account balance. Your days of me celebrating
an extra penny every few weeks feel like just yesterday, but it looks
like if you’re lucky you might just come close to catching up to your
brother after all! Hopeful, you close your laptop and check back at the
end of the experiment.</p>
<p>As expected, your brother closed his journey with his $146,000 and
“generously” invited you to join him on his vacation to Cancun. You
check on your account to see how far behind you are. Maybe, if you’re
not <em>too</em> far behind, you’ll surprise him by offering to
contribute to the cost.</p>

<p>Your mouth drops. No, that can’t be right. <em>Over 2 million
dollars?</em> There must be some mistake.</p>
<p>But there isn’t. Your little $1 account that earned “an extra penny”
every few weeks at the beginning is now earning almost
<strong><em>$21,000 every single day</em></strong>. Maybe you should
<em>buy</em> a property in Cancun and offer to let your poor brother
stay there? 😉</p>
<h2 id="what-happened-what-happened">What happened?
{#what-happened?}</h2>
<p>How in the world did you end up with more than 2 million dollars?
Well, for the first two years, your initial gut instinct was 100% right–
the $100/day linear approach (red) far outperforms the 1% approach
(green):</p>

<p>So here’s lesson #1: humans think <em>linearly</em>, but compound
interest works <em>exponentially</em>. It doesn’t matter how often I run
these simulations, it doesn’t matter how often I do the math, this fact
constantly surprises and delights me. It never really becomes intuitive–
that’s why it’s the eighth wonder of the world.</p>
<p>Now, you’re not going to find any bank that will offer you a 1% per
day interest rate (if you do, let me know, because I wouldn’t mind
becoming a trillionaire 😉). This is just an example to illustrate the
power of compound interest:</p>
<p>No matter what the interest rate, no matter what the initial amount,
<em>any</em> interest rate will exponentially outperform <em>any</em>
linear graph <em>if you give it enough time</em>.</p>
<h2 id="calculating-compound-growth">Calculating compound growth</h2>
<p>As I said earlier, compound growth is hard for us humans to naturally
intuit because our brains can’t help but think linearly, so we need
math. There is a formula you can use to calculate the value of a number
if it grows at a certain percentage rate:</p>
<p>Final value = Starting value * ((1 + interest rate)number of times
compounded)</p>
<p>Let’s apply that to the 1% per day example from earlier. We represent
the 1% = .01 as a decimal, and plug in 1,461 (the number of days in 4
years)</p>
<p>Final value = $1.00 * (1 + .01)1461</p>
<p>If you plug that into your calculator, you’ll see that beautiful $2+
million number from before.</p>
<p>But of course real banks and investments don’t pay 1% per day. Let’s
try a realistic example.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 is an index that tracks the stock values of the
largest 500 public companies in the US. It’s a decent indicator of the
overall US stock market, and has historically increased at an average of
10% per year. Let’s see how $1,000 would do on average across 1 year, 5
years, 10 year, and 25 years, compounded annually:</p>

<h2 id="estimating-compound-growth">Estimating compound growth</h2>
<p>You’ll notice in the example above that between years 5 and 10 we
passed an interesting milestone— we <em>doubled</em> the initial amount.
Specifically, we reached the doubling point for a 10% return after about
7 years, 3 months. Try plugging in different starting amounts– it
doesn’t matter– at a 10% rate of return, you’ll always have double
whatever you started with after about 7 years, 3 months.</p>
<p>If you try with a 9% rate of return, you’ll find that doubling takes
a little longer at 8 years.<br />
If you try with an 8% rate of return, it takes even longer, doubling
after 9 years.<br />
And if you try with a 1% interest rate, it doubles after about 72
years.</p>
<p>Do you see the pattern between the rate of return and the time in
which your investment first doubles? Congratulations, you just
discovered the famous “rule of 72.” Whenever someone tells you a yearly
rate of return, just divide 72 by that number and the answer tells you
about how many years it will take for that interest rate to double the
amount you put in.</p>
<p>72 / 6 is 12. So a 6% interest rate will double its value every 12
years.<br />
72 / 4 is 18. So a 4% interest rate will double its value every 18
years.</p>
<p>So, without using your calculator, can you estimate how much you’d
have if you put $1,000 into an account earning 10% yearly after 29
years?</p>
<p>72 / 10 = 7.2, meaning the account doubles every 7.2 years. We know 7
goes into 28 four times. And the 0.2s added four times on top give us an
extra one to arrive at about 29. So we can expect the amount will double
4 times over the 29 years. So we should see the amount go from $1,000 to
$2,000 over the first seven years, from $2,000 to $4,000 during the
second seven years, from $4,000 to $8,000 over the third seven years,
and from $8,000 to $16,000 over the fourth seven years.</p>

<p>Let’s look again at the example we tried earlier with the S&amp;P

$1,000 initial investment to keep things simple.</p>

<p>If you chart this out, you’ll see that the S&amp;P 500 graph has the
same hockey stick shape as the rich uncle graph from earlier– gradual
growth at first, then it accelerates and accelerates, driving
exponentially upward, each year much more powerful than the previous
year.</p>
<p><img src="images/sp500-growth-graph.png"
alt="S&amp;P 500 growth graph" /> But what would happen if we delay that
investment by just 5 years? Maybe we really want to get that new game
console. Maybe the market is looking shaky right now. Maybe we want to
take some time to wait until we feel confident taking the plunge to tie
up our money in the stock market.</p>
<p>Let’s game that out. Let’s hold on to that $1,000 and invest it <em>5
years from now</em>. In other words, let’s let it grow for 20 years
instead of 25.</p>
<p>It should be no big deal, right? Shaving 5 years off our 25 year
investment time reduces our time in the market by only 20%. We saw that
our $1,000 grew an extra $10,000 over 25 years, So if we’re leaving the
money in there for 80% of that time, we should see 80% of that growth–
$8,000 on top of our $1,000. Sure, it’s not 10x like before, but 8x is
still pretty good, right?</p>
<p>Let’s model it out and see what this looks like. To make things
simple, I’ll start it from year 5. The red line shows the value of what
you would have had if you’d invested 5 years earlier, and the blue shows
what you would have if you waited 5 years.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/delayed-investment-impact.png"
alt="Impact of delayed investment" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Impact of delayed investment</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Ouch.</p>
<p>Our $1,000 over 25 years reached almost $11,000. But if we delay our
investment by just 5 years, we finish with only about $6,700. We
invested the same $1,000 in both scenarios. But the decision to delay
our long-term investment by only 5 years cost us $4,300 or 43% of the
growth we would have had if we’d started 5 years earlier.</p>
<p>Uh-oh, we were thinking linearly again!</p>
<p>You might think, “well I’m investing for retirement, I’m thinking
<em>50 years</em> down the road, not 25! 5 years is a big chunk of 25
years, but surely it’s just a drop in the bucket <em>50</em> years from
now!”</p>
<p>You might think that. But you’d be wrong.</p>
<p>The 5-year delayed investment would certainly perform well. 45 years
of growth at 10% would turn your $1,000 into $72,890. An almost 73x
increase, nice! But if we had invested from the start and gotten the
full 50 years of growth, it would have been $117,390– a mind-boggling
<em>118x</em> increase! At a 50 year time horizon, the 5 year delay will
have cost you $44,500– still a whopping 38% of what you could have had,
and more than half of what you actually have now.</p>
<p>What do we learn from this?</p>
<p><strong>TIME IS YOUR MOST VALUABLE RESOURCE.</strong></p>
<p>Every year, every month, every <em>day</em> you delay putting a
dollar to work decreases the future earning power of that dollar. If $1
invested today has the potential to become $100 by the time you retire,
that’s exciting! But it also means that last year it probably had the
potential to become $120. And next year, it will only have the potential
to be $80. Thus the adage: “The best time to invest was yesterday which
means the second best time is today.”</p>
<h2 id="your-wealth-multiplier">Your Wealth Multiplier</h2>
<p>What a great idea– that each of your dollars has a different
potential growth factor depending on how long it has left in the market.
The great folks at the Money Guy have given this growth factor idea a
name. They call it the Wealth Multiplier.</p>
<p>You could come up with a simple formula yourself using the equations
we covered earlier. If you assume you invest in the S&amp;P 500, earning
10% annually, you can run this equation:</p>
<p>Wealth Multiplier = 1.1years until retirement</p>
<p>So if you’re 30 and you plan to retire at 65, your wealth multiplier
is 1.135, which is about 28. You can expect every dollar you invest
today to grow to about $28 by the time you retire.</p>
<p>But that’s not realistic. You’re not going to want to stay invested
solely in the high-growth but highly volatile S&amp;P 500 your whole
life<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>– you’re going to want to gradually
start trading higher returns for higher stability as you get closer to
retirement age.</p>
<p>So the folks at the Money Guy Show put together a more realistic (but
also more complicated) formula that assumes a 10% rate of return 45+
years out from retirement, decreasing by 0.1% per year until retirement,
compounded monthly. It’s too complex to put into a memorable formula, so
I won’t bother writing it here, but how the number changes as you
age:</p>
<p>Here’s how the wealth multiplier works out over time, assuming a
target retirement age of 65. Again, linear thinking will sabotage you;
notice how quickly the number falls off a cliff as you age.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/wealth-multiplier-age-graph.png"
alt="Wealth multiplier by age graph" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Wealth multiplier by age
graph</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I’m currently 35, so My wealth multiplier is 12.69. I can reasonably
expect that any money I have in the market (or put into the market)
today will grow to 12.69x its current value by the time I turn 65.</p>
<p>What was my wealth multiplier at 30? It was about 23. When I was 25,
that number was 44. when I was 20, it was an astounding 88!</p>
<p>Which leads to my unpleasant confession…</p>
<h2 id="my-multi-million-dollar-mistake">My multi-million dollar
mistake</h2>
<p>This is where my regret comes and kicks me in the teeth. In the
introduction, I said my wife and I did all the <em>hard</em> work of
saving and budgeting, but didn’t do the <em>easy</em> work. Here’s what
I mean.</p>
<p>Where did we put all the money we worked so hard to save? In a
<em>savings</em> account, of course (isn’t that what it’s for?). I had
no idea how the financial world of investment worked. The little I’d
heard from news articles and blog posts scared me. I knew that investing
entailed “risk–” a word that sounded like gambling in my mind. I heard
investing was complicated, and people were constantly disagreeing on how
to do it, and many offered “advice” that was dangerous or actually a
sales pitch for their product. And I heard there were a bunch of tax
rules that could ruin you if you didn’t know exactly what you were
doing.</p>
<p>I was terrified of falling for some bad investment or making a tax
mistake so year after year, I procrastinated doing the work to learn how
this whole “investing” thing works. I kept all that money on the
sidelines while my wealth multiplier dropped from 88… to 44… to 23… etc.
I didn’t learn about the wealth multiplier until mine had dropped all
the way to <em>18</em>.</p>
<p>Once I learned about the power of compound interest and the wealth
multiplier, I flushed my cash into the market as quickly as I dared… but
the damage was already done. If I had been pumping the money I saved
into <em>investments</em> instead of just <em>savings accounts</em>
during my 20s, that money would have grown to <em>several million
dollars</em> by the time I retire.</p>
<p>I’m still working to pump extra in to try and accelerate my growth,
and we’ll do okay in the end. But if we had just nudged the direction of
our existing effort a few degrees, we could have retired very early and
taken our foot off the savings pedal way earlier. But it’s impossible to
buy back that lost time. That’s why I want you to start
<em>now</em>.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-2:-your-financial-success-plan">Chapter 2: Your
Financial Success Plan</h1>
<p>We’ve talked about the big ideas, now let’s start getting into the
specifics. I’ll keep each section as brief as possible.</p>

<h3
id="live-within-your-means-obviously-live-within-your-means-obviously">Live
within your means (obviously) {#live-within-your-means-(obviously)}</h3>
<p>This is the hard part– the part I actually did! Spend less than you
make and follow a budget. If you’re like me, having software to
categorize your expenses and track how you’re doing is a must-have. But
whether you like to go the pen-and-paper route, a spreadsheet, etc, it
doesn’t matter. Just remember: every dollar is a soldier in your army.
If you aren’t keeping track of where your soldiers are and what they’re
doing, you’re not getting the value you need out of them.</p>

{#use-credit-cards-(but-don’t-let-them-use-you)}</h3>
<p>Credit cards give you consumer protections you don’t get with a debit
card. Plus, many offer rewards (like 2%+ cash back). Choose 2-3 credit
cards that will give you the best rewards for your expenses (<a
href="https://clark.com/credit-cards/">here’s a good guide on choosing
the best cards</a>) and set them up to auto-pay in full every month.
Credit card <em>debt</em>, we hate; credit card <em>use</em> is
great!</p>
<h3 id="stretch-your-dollars">Stretch your dollars</h3>
<p>My cell phone plan costs a quarter of the plan my friends have, and
I’m on the same network as them. The cereal my kids eat costs half of
their friends’ cereal and tastes just as good. Our family spends half
the amount as other families on the same medicines. And we spend far
less than the average family in our area on groceries.</p>
<p>How do we do this? By taking a little bit of time to research. I use
an MVNO carrier for my phone plan instead of AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, or
Verizon. We shop at Walmart, Aldi, and Sam’s Club instead of Publix or
Target or Trader Joes. We buy store brand instead of name brand. We unit
price instead of blinding grabbing the first item on the shelves. We
compare prescription prices across pharmacies.</p>
<p>It’s amazing how much further you can make your dollars go when you
are willing to go against the stream, find out what providers are out
there others may not be aware of, and compare your options.</p>
<p>The best general resource I’ve found for learning how to save money
across the many aspects of your life is <a
href="https://clark.com/">Clark Howard</a>. His website (and daily show)
will help you save money on everything from health to cell phones to
streaming to groceries to travel. Many people and families can easily
save 20+% on their daily spending.</p>
<h2 id="debt-a-powerful-deadly-tool-debt-a-powerful-deadly-tool">Debt: a
powerful, deadly tool {#debt:-a-powerful,-deadly-tool}</h2>
<p>Debt is like a chainsaw. If you’re careful, you can do awesome things
like clear acres of wilderness. If you’re not careful, you can clear
your head from your body. A good rule of thumb: never take on debt
except for the following:</p>
<h3 id="mortgage">Mortgage</h3>
<p>You likely won’t afford to buy a house in cash. But your first house
should be modest. Make sure to put at least 5% down on your first house
(20%+ down on future home purchases). Make sure your mortgage (principal
+ interest + property tax + homeowners insurance) is 25% or less of your
total income.</p>
<h3 id="education">Education</h3>
<p>If needed, you can go into debt to pay for your school. But make sure
your total loan amount doesn’t exceed what you expect to earn during
your first year’s salary out of school. You can save a LOT of money by
doing your first few years of school at a community college before
transferring to a university. Pursue scholarships and grants– that’s
free money, and many are not tied to income.</p>
<h3 id="vehicle">Vehicle</h3>
<p>Paying for a car in cash is ideal. But if you really need to get a
car loan, you can. Make sure you are buying a modest car (“think
Corolla, not Land Cruiser”). Prioritize buying used cars so someone else
eats the depreciation. And for the loan, the rule is 20/3/8. Pay 20+%
down, take on a loan no longer than 3 years, and don’t let your loan
payments exceed 8% of your income.</p>
<h2 id="saving-and-investing">Saving and investing</h2>
<h3 id="can-do-wonders-for-you-25-can-do-wonders-for-you">25% can do
wonders for you {#25%-can-do-wonders-for-you}</h3>
<p>Strive to save/invest 25% of your income each paycheck. 25% is higher
than the traditional 10-15% rate many financial pundits have
traditionally required and far beyond the &lt;5% of the average
American. But you probably won’t have social security to fall back on
and you’re not average. Saving 25%– especially right now when your
dollars are orders of magnitude more powerful than they will be in
another 5, 10, 20 years– will give you immense flexibility down the
road, maybe to even retire 10 or 15 years early!</p>
<p>When you’re just starting out and you have very little income, that
may seem insane. In which case, start by doing what you can. 10%, 15%,
whatever. Make 25% your goal, and work on raising your savings rate each
year. Then, as you get raises through the next several years, dedicate
half of your raise to increasing your savings rate and you’ll hit 25% in
a few years.</p>

<p>Remember the order of operations from math class? “Please Excuse My
Dear Aunt Sally” helped you remember to calculate Parentheses,
Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction in that
order and gave you clear instructions for what to do with your next
calculation.</p>
<p>The Financial Order of Operations gives you clear guidelines on what
to do with your next dollar. Every time you get a paycheck, you need to
ask yourself, “what step am I on?” and put at least 25% of your paycheck
toward that step.</p>

<h3 id="step-1:-deductibles-covered">Step 1: Deductibles Covered</h3>
<h4 id="first-lets-talk-about-insurance">First, let’s talk about
insurance</h4>
<p>People fear catastrophe. So we all pitch a few dollars into a big
pool of money. The person running the pool takes a cut. And when
catastrophe hits a few of us, they get the money in the pool. The rest
of us get no money, but that’s good because that means catastrophe
didn’t hit us. And we sleep better at night knowing there’s a big pool
of money waiting for us if it does.</p>
<p>That’s insurance– it protects you from some of the major risks of
life. Auto insurance pays for replacement or repair to your car if it
gets wrecked. Homeowners insurance if your house gets wrecked. Health
insurance pays when your body gets wrecked. And life insurance pays your
family if your “stay alive” parts get completely wrecked.</p>
<p>Insurance includes a few different costs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Premiums</strong>: this is what you pay for the privilege of
being in the insurance. It’s like a gym membership or a Spotify
subscription– it doesn’t matter whether you use it or not, you have to
pay for it every month.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Deductible</strong>: This is the amount of your costs that’s
completely on you. For example, if you have a $1,000 deductible,
insurance isn’t going to lift a finger to cover costs until you have
paid $1,000 of your own money to the problem (which is what it means to
“meet your deductible”). Requiring you to put some skin in the game
first means you will be more careful in how you act and spend. Not every
insurance plan has a deductible (this will be important when we talk
about HSAs later).<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Coinsurance:</strong> If you have no deductible (or if
you’ve already met it), the insurance is likely not going to start
covering <em>all</em> your expenses right away. Instead, you will share
the responsibility of paying. Insurance will pay some percentage (50%,
75%, 90%, etc) and you’ll pay the rest.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Copays:</strong> Even when the insurance company is paying
their percentage, they still want you to have more skin in the game and
avoid unnecessary expenses. So they will often require you to pay a flat
amount of each service (like $25 per doctor visit) before they will
start splitting the rest of the cost with you.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Out of pocket maximum:</strong> Finally, a term that is
intuitively named! Once you’ve paid this amount of money in deductibles
and coinsurance and copays, you’re done! Everything for the rest of the
year is free (except your premiums, of course).</li>
</ul>
<p>When you enroll in an insurance plan, you’ll trade off one cost for
another cost. Think of it this way: if you have no insurance, you have
no guaranteed cost every month, but you have a very high possible cost
if something goes wrong. On the other end of the spectrum, you can pay a
ton in guaranteed monthly costs and in exchange the insurance company
will pay almost everything for you. When you are presented with multiple
insurance options, you will need to figure out where you want to be
along that spectrum of risk and responsibility.</p>
<h4 id="applying-that-to-step-1">Applying that to step 1</h4>
<p>Between your health, home, and car insurance, what’s the highest
deductible you’d have to pay in those policies if something went wrong?
The first step is to save up that amount in a high-yield savings account
you can access any time. This should give you a little bit of an
emergency cushion so if something goes wrong, you don’t have to go get a
loan.</p>
<h3 id="step-2:-employer-match">Step 2: Employer Match</h3>
<p>At most companies you’ll likely have access to an employer-sponsored
retirement plan. If you do, your employer may offer a match on your
contributions. For example, if you contribute 4% of your income to your
retirement plan, your employer may add another 2% on top of that. This
is <strong>literally free money</strong>, and you’re stupid if you turn
it down. Enroll in at least the bare minimum contribution to your 401k
to get the full employer match. If you have the choice between Roth and
traditional 401k accounts, go with the Roth.<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>If you are enrolled in a high-deductible health plan through your
employer, your employer may also offer a match on your contributions to
an HSA (more on HSAs and health insurance in a minute). Again, that
match is <strong>free money</strong>, and you should get on that right
away!</p>
<h3 id="step-3:-high-interest-debt">Step 3: High-Interest Debt</h3>
<p>Once you’ve built up some breathing room and got your free money,
let’s do a gut-check on your spending. If you didn’t follow the debt
advice from earlier in the chapter, that’s your next priority. A debt
with an interest rate &gt; 8-10% is going to hurt you more than an
investment is going to help you.</p>
<p>If it feels depressing to spend so much on debt, think of it this
way: paying off a $1,000 balance on a 20% credit card has the same
effect on your overall net worth as investing $1,000 in an account
earning 20%– which is far above any return you’ll see in the market in a
normal year. So every dollar you spend on step 3 is FAR more powerful
than the dollars you’ll be investing later. Fight through it!</p>
<h3 id="step-4-emergency-reserves">Step 4: Emergency Reserves</h3>
<p>You started your emergency fund in step 1 to give yourself a little
bit of breathing room. And now that you’re not in danger from debt, you
can shift your attention and expand that “breathing room” into a runway
you can use to launch forward into <em>growth</em>. Save up enough money
in your emergency fund to cover 3-6 months of your normal living
expenses. So if you lose your job or unexpectedly have to replace your
car, you’re not back to square one.</p>
<h3 id="step-5-roth-hsa">Step 5: Roth &amp; HSA</h3>
<p>Now we’re ready to finally get serious about investing for your
future! We’ll start with your HSA and Roth accounts:</p>
<h4 id="hsa-your-most-powerful-account">HSA: your most powerful
account</h4>
<p>When you choose a health insurance plan, I strongly urge you to
consider a “high-deductitble” health plan, especially when you’re young
and healthy. A high-deductible plan is simply a health plan with a
deductible high enough that it meets the IRS definition of “high” (at
the time of this writing, that’s $1,650 for individuals and $3,300 for
families). Having a high-deductible plan gives you many benefits:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Lower premiums<br />
</li>
<li>“Skin in the game” encouraging you to comparison-shop and reduce
your health costs<br />
</li>
<li>It makes you eligible for a Health Savings Account (HSA).</li>
</ol>
<p>That last one is key. An HSA is the most powerful account type in
your arsenal for saving for the future because not only will many
employers match your contributions (see step 2), but HSAs are triple–
sometimes even <em>quadruple</em> tax-advantaged! What does that
mean?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If it’s an employer-sponsored HSA, you can likely tell your employer
to take your contributions directly out of your paycheck. This
contribution comes out before payroll (social security and medicare)
taxes.<br />
</li>
<li>Any amount you contribute is also exempt from your income
taxes<br />
</li>
<li>The contributions and the growth of the account over time grows
tax-free<br />
</li>
<li>And you can withdraw them tax-free!</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, unlike HSA’s disappointing cousin (the FSA), the money
in your HSA is yours forever– there is no “use it or lose it” rule at
the end of the year. You can keep using your HSA funds for the rest of
your life, no matter what health plan you have at the time!</p>
<h1 id="how-you-can-get-started">How You Can Get Started</h1>
<p>I’ve tried to collect the “big ideas” together and help you
understand the <em>amazing</em> potential your dollars have if you start
early. I hope this lit a fire under you to hit the ground running. Your
most powerful year to shape your financial future is the year you first
get started. Don’t lose out.</p>
<p>But you’ll need more than just big ideas about compound interest and
the wealth multiplier. You need to know how to choose an affordable
brokerage, how to prioritize emergency savings, what types of accounts
to use to minimize your tax burden, and so much more.</p>
<p>Your best friend in this journey is going to be the book <a
href="https://moneyguy.com/millionairemission/">Millionaire Mission by
Brian Preston</a>. He covers the big principles I talked about here in
much greater detail. But he also outlines a 9-step “order of operations”
for your personal financial life so you always know the most efficient
thing to do with your next dollar in each stage of life. He also gives
you great rules of thumb around mortgage, car, and school loans, Roth v
traditional retirement accounts, and many other important guides. No
gimmicks, no sales pitches, nothing fancy or risky. You aren’t trying to
beat the market– just <em>ride</em> the market in the safest, most
tax-efficient way possible.</p>
<p>The next resource would be Brian’s show, <a
href="https://moneyguy.com/">The Money Guy Show</a> on YouTube or
podcasts. His website also has a ton of free resources like the wealth
multiplier calculator, a net worth tool, and other great stuff. He also
has a few paid video courses to calculate your retirement number, learn
the financial order of operations, and much more that are well worth it
in my opinion.</p>
<p>If you’re new to this world, some parts of his show itself will seem
confusing at first. Just like how the Latter-day Saint culture and
vocabulary is overwhelming to a new convert at first. Read or listen to
the book first, and then stuff in the show will make more sense. Immerse
yourself in it, and you’ll start picking it up faster than you would
have thought.</p>
<p>The next resource would be <a href="https://clark.com">the Clark
Howard show</a>. He is less focused on big picture financial planning
concepts and more the day to day application of wise financial
principles and squeezing the best out of every dollar. He’s got great
information on everything from how to get the best cell phone plan for
your needs, how to save on airfare, the best way to maximize your credit
card rewards, and so much more. He speaks slowly, so listen to his
podcast on 1.5x speed!</p>
