<h1 id="">How You Can Get Started</h1>
<p>I‚Äôve tried to collect the ‚Äúbig ideas‚Äù together and help you
understand the <em>amazing</em> potential your dollars have if you start
early. I hope this lit a fire under you to hit the ground running. Your
most powerful year to shape your financial future is the year you first
get started. Don‚Äôt lose out.</p>
<p>But you‚Äôll need more than just big ideas about compound interest and
the wealth multiplier. You need to know how to choose an affordable
brokerage, how to prioritize emergency savings, what types of accounts
to use to minimize your tax burden, and so much more.</p>
<p>Your best friend in this journey is going to be the book <a
href="https://moneyguy.com/millionairemission/">Millionaire Mission by
Brian Preston</a>. He covers the big principles I talked about here in
much greater detail. But he also outlines a 9-step ‚Äúorder of operations‚Äù
for your personal financial life so you always know the most efficient
thing to do with your next dollar in each stage of life. He also gives
you great rules of thumb around mortgage, car, and school loans, Roth v
traditional retirement accounts, and many other important guides. No
gimmicks, no sales pitches, nothing fancy or risky. You aren‚Äôt trying to
beat the market‚Äì just <em>ride</em> the market in the safest, most
tax-efficient way possible.</p>
<p>The next resource would be Brian‚Äôs show, <a
href="https://moneyguy.com/">The Money Guy Show</a> on YouTube or
podcasts. His website also has a ton of free resources like the wealth
multiplier calculator, a net worth tool, and other great stuff. He also
has a few paid video courses to calculate your retirement number, learn
the financial order of operations, and much more that are well worth it
in my opinion.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre new to this world, some parts of his show itself will seem
confusing at first. Just like how the Latter-day Saint culture and
vocabulary is overwhelming to a new convert at first. Read or listen to
the book first, and then stuff in the show will make more sense. Immerse
yourself in it, and you‚Äôll start picking it up faster than you would
have thought.</p>
<p>The next resource would be <a href="https://clark.com">the Clark
Howard show</a>. He is less focused on big picture financial planning
concepts and more the day to day application of wise financial
principles and squeezing the best out of every dollar. He‚Äôs got great
information on everything from how to get the best cell phone plan for
your needs, how to save on airfare, the best way to maximize your credit
card rewards, and so much more. He speaks slowly, so listen to his
podcast on 1.5x speed!</p>
