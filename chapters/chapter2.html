<h1 id="">Chapter 1: The eighth
wonder of the world</h1>
<h2 id="">The rich uncle</h2>
<p>Let’s play a game and see how human intuition plays out. Suppose a
rich uncle leaves you and your brother an inheritance in his will. His
estate will create a simple checking account for you and contribute
money into it every day for the next 4 years, after which, the money in
the account is yours. You can choose two different ways to earn:</p>
<p><strong>The $100/day plan:</strong> Very simple. His estate deposits
$100 into your account every day for the next 4 years.</p>
<p><strong>The 1% plan:</strong> Your account gets one dollar to start.
Then his estate increases the account value by 1% every day for the next
4 years.</p>
<p>The answer seems pretty clear: $100 per day for free, that’s
<em>awesome</em>! You and your brother both sign up. But to your horror,
you get too excited and accidentally sign up for the 1% plan!</p>
<p>You’re understandably bummed. Intuitively, this doesn’t sound
terribly exciting. 1% of your dollar is just a penny. Earn a penny a day
for four years, and you’ll have earned a whopping $14.61 in interest.
Meanwhile, your friends in Account B will have earned $146,100 during
those four years!</p>
<p>You’re feeling pretty bitter about this, so you track your account
balance over time so you can quantify just how much that mistaken button
click will cost you. Looking at the first two weeks, your depression is
completely justified:</p>

<p>As expected, you receive a penny into your account each day while
your brother is raking in <em>10,000x</em> that much every day. But I’ll
point you to Day 11 where you’ll see something weird there– you got an
extra cent on that day– a <em>whole extra cent</em>! That extra penny is
why I’m so excited for you choosing the 1% plan.</p>
<p><em>“So, I get an extra penny every week or two? So I won’t earn $13
over four years, maybe I’ll earn $16 or something? Not exactly a great
consolation prize.”</em></p>
<p>Look, I get this example underwhelming so far. But I want to show you
the power behind that extra penny. This tiny little example is your
first introduction to the eighth wonder of the world: <em>compound
growth</em>. That’s when the interest you earned earlier multiplies and
creates its own interest on top of itself. It’s like your money is
having babies!</p>
<p>Still not convinced? I get it. Let’s give it some time and check back
after a month:</p>

<p>Okay, so another <em>three</em> “extra pennies” were added during the
final two weeks of the month. That’s nice, but you still don’t even have
enough to buy a Costco hotdog. Meanwhile while your insufferable brother
is apparently earning enough to pay his mortgage, and with cash to
spare!</p>
<p>Let’s check back after about 3 months:</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>In the past <em>90</em> days, you got <em>144</em> pennies– that’s
<em>54 extra pennies!</em> It’s encouraging to see a little increase in
the frequency of our “extra penny” phenomenon. But it doesn’t change the
vast overwhelm. Here we are 3 months out and you can’t even buy a value
menu burger from McDonalds. But your brother can now buy a decent used
car.</p>
<p>You’re getting really depressed. Let’s stop obsessing over this and
check back at the end of the year:</p>

<p>Well it’s been a long year. Has your account blossomed into something
cool? Well, I think so! You expected a penny per day– a little over
$4.00 by this point, but you have almost $40! Those extra pennies are
coming in all the time now, not just every several days. Isn’t that
exciting?</p>
<p><em>“No, my brother has enough for a down payment on a new house,
while I still can’t even afford to take a date to get some decent
Mexican food!”</em></p>
<p>Understood. Let’s take a break for another year and check back
then.</p>

<p>Huh, that’s different! You had less than $40 after a year, you might
have expected $80 or so after 2 years– maybe a little more from those
“extra pennies.” But your account balance is now <em>18 times</em> that!
If you look at the day by day balance changes, you’ll find that you’re
not earning an occasional extra penny anymore– now you’re earning a
solid $12+ dollars <em>per day</em>. Cool!</p>
<p><em>“Yeah but $12/day is nothing compared to $100/day. We’re already
halfway through the 4 years and my brother is WAY ahead and I’m still
earning nowhere close to him. He’s getting rich and there’s no way I’ll
come close to catching up! Maybe he’ll have pity on me and invite me on
his nice vacation. Well, at least maybe I see it’s starting to grow
fast. Who knows, maybe it will grow to $5,000 by the time this is done.
Do I dare hope to see ten?”</em></p>
<p>Okay, okay, let’s check again after year 3.</p>

<p>Well your brother has crossed into six figures, and he’s gleefully
telling you all the things he’s going to do now that he’s “wealthy.” You
were maybe afraid to look at your own balance. You’re starting to
realize this interest rate thing is weird, so you don’t know what to
expect last year’s $1,400 grew into.</p>
<p>You open your account and you’re shocked to see you are almost
halfway to your brother’s account balance. Your days of me celebrating
an extra penny every few weeks feel like just yesterday, but it looks
like if you’re lucky you might just come close to catching up to your
brother after all! Hopeful, you close your laptop and check back at the
end of the experiment.</p>
<p>As expected, your brother closed his journey with his $146,000 and
“generously” invited you to join him on his vacation to Cancun. You
check on your account to see how far behind you are. Maybe, if you’re
not <em>too</em> far behind, you’ll surprise him by offering to
contribute to the cost.</p>

<p>Your mouth drops. No, that can’t be right. <em>Over 2 million
dollars?</em> There must be some mistake.</p>
<p>But there isn’t. Your little $1 account that earned “an extra penny”
every few weeks at the beginning is now earning almost
<strong><em>$21,000 every single day</em></strong>. Maybe you should
<em>buy</em> a property in Cancun and offer to let your poor brother
stay there? 😉</p>
<h2 id="">What happened?
{#what-happened?}</h2>
<p>How in the world did you end up with more than 2 million dollars?
Well, for the first two years, your initial gut instinct was 100% right–
the $100/day linear approach (red) far outperforms the 1% approach
(green):</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/compound-interest-linear-vs-exponential.png"
alt="Compound interest: linear vs exponential" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Compound interest: linear vs
exponential</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But sometime shortly into year three, the lines swap places and your
previously laughable 1% per day account absolutely destroys your
brother’s account:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/compound-interest-crossover.png"
alt="Compound interest crossover point" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Compound interest crossover

</figure>
<p>So here’s lesson #1: humans think <em>linearly</em>, but compound
interest works <em>exponentially</em>. It doesn’t matter how often I run
these simulations, it doesn’t matter how often I do the math, this fact
constantly surprises and delights me. It never really becomes intuitive–
that’s why it’s the eighth wonder of the world.</p>
<p>Now, you’re not going to find any bank that will offer you a 1% per
day interest rate (if you do, let me know, because I wouldn’t mind
becoming a trillionaire 😉). This is just an example to illustrate the
power of compound interest:</p>
<p>No matter what the interest rate, no matter what the initial amount,
<em>any</em> interest rate will exponentially outperform <em>any</em>
linear graph <em>if you give it enough time</em>.</p>
<h2 id="">Calculating compound growth</h2>
<p>As I said earlier, compound growth is hard for us humans to naturally
intuit because our brains can’t help but think linearly, so we need
math. There is a formula you can use to calculate the value of a number
if it grows at a certain percentage rate:</p>
<p>Final value = Starting value * ((1 + interest rate)number of times
compounded)</p>
<p>Let’s apply that to the 1% per day example from earlier. We represent
the 1% = .01 as a decimal, and plug in 1,461 (the number of days in 4
years)</p>
<p>Final value = $1.00 * (1 + .01)1461</p>
<p>If you plug that into your calculator, you’ll see that beautiful $2+
million number from before.</p>
<p>But of course real banks and investments don’t pay 1% per day. Let’s
try a realistic example.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 is an index that tracks the stock values of the
largest 500 public companies in the US. It’s a decent indicator of the
overall US stock market, and has historically increased at an average of
10% per year. Let’s see how $1,000 would do on average across 1 year, 5
years, 10 year, and 25 years, compounded annually:</p>

<h2 id="">Estimating compound growth</h2>
<p>You’ll notice in the example above that between years 5 and 10 we
passed an interesting milestone— we <em>doubled</em> the initial amount.
Specifically, we reached the doubling point for a 10% return after about
7 years, 3 months. Try plugging in different starting amounts– it
doesn’t matter– at a 10% rate of return, you’ll always have double
whatever you started with after about 7 years, 3 months.</p>
<p>If you try with a 9% rate of return, you’ll find that doubling takes
a little longer at 8 years.<br />
If you try with an 8% rate of return, it takes even longer, doubling
after 9 years.<br />
And if you try with a 1% interest rate, it doubles after about 72
years.</p>
<p>Do you see the pattern between the rate of return and the time in
which your investment first doubles? Congratulations, you just
discovered the famous “rule of 72.” Whenever someone tells you a yearly
rate of return, just divide 72 by that number and the answer tells you
about how many years it will take for that interest rate to double the
amount you put in.</p>
<p>72 / 6 is 12. So a 6% interest rate will double its value every 12
years.<br />
72 / 4 is 18. So a 4% interest rate will double its value every 18
years.</p>
<p>So, without using your calculator, can you estimate how much you’d
have if you put $1,000 into an account earning 10% yearly after 29
years?</p>
<p>72 / 10 = 7.2, meaning the account doubles every 7.2 years. We know 7
goes into 28 four times. And the 0.2s added four times on top give us an
extra one to arrive at about 29. So we can expect the amount will double
4 times over the 29 years. So we should see the amount go from $1,000 to
$2,000 over the first seven years, from $2,000 to $4,000 during the
second seven years, from $4,000 to $8,000 over the third seven years,
and from $8,000 to $16,000 over the fourth seven years.</p>
