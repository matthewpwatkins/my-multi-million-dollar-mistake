<h1 id="">Chapter 2: Your
Financial Success Plan</h1>
<p>We’ve talked about the big ideas, now let’s start getting into the
specifics. I’ll keep each section as brief as possible.</p>
<h2 id="">Optimize your spending</h2>
<h3
id="">Live
within your means (obviously)</h3>
<p>This is the hard part– the part I actually did! Spend less than you
make and follow a budget. If you’re like me, having software to
categorize your expenses and track how you’re doing is a must-have. But
whether you like to go the pen-and-paper route, a spreadsheet, etc, it
doesn’t matter. Just remember: every dollar is a soldier in your army.
If you aren’t keeping track of where your soldiers are and what they’re
doing, you’re not getting the value you need out of them.</p>
<h3
id="">Use
credit cards (but don’t let them use you)
{#use-credit-cards-(but-don’t-let-them-use-you)}</h3>
<p>Credit cards give you consumer protections you don’t get with a debit
card. Plus, many offer rewards (like 2%+ cash back). Choose 2-3 credit
cards that will give you the best rewards for your expenses (<a
href="https://clark.com/credit-cards/">here’s a good guide on choosing
the best cards</a>) and set them up to auto-pay in full every month.
Credit card <em>debt</em>, we hate; credit card <em>use</em> is
great!</p>
<h3 id="">Stretch your dollars</h3>
<p>My cell phone plan costs a quarter of the plan my friends have, and
I’m on the same network as them. The cereal my kids eat costs half of
their friends’ cereal and tastes just as good. Our family spends half
the amount as other families on the same medicines. And we spend far
less than the average family in our area on groceries.</p>
<p>How do we do this? By taking a little bit of time to research. I use
an MVNO carrier for my phone plan instead of AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, or
Verizon. We shop at Walmart, Aldi, and Sam’s Club instead of Publix or
Target or Trader Joes. We buy store brand instead of name brand. We unit
price instead of blinding grabbing the first item on the shelves. We
compare prescription prices across pharmacies.</p>
<p>It’s amazing how much further you can make your dollars go when you
are willing to go against the stream, find out what providers are out
there others may not be aware of, and compare your options.</p>
<p>The best general resource I’ve found for learning how to save money
across the many aspects of your life is <a
href="https://clark.com/">Clark Howard</a>. His website (and daily show)
will help you save money on everything from health to cell phones to
streaming to groceries to travel. Many people and families can easily
save 20+% on their daily spending.</p>
<h2 id="">Debt: a
powerful, deadly tool</h2>
<p>Debt is like a chainsaw. If you’re careful, you can do awesome things
like clear acres of wilderness. If you’re not careful, you can clear
your head from your body. A good rule of thumb: never take on debt
except for the following:</p>
<h3 id="">Mortgage</h3>
<p>You likely won’t afford to buy a house in cash. But your first house
should be modest. Make sure to put at least 5% down on your first house
(20%+ down on future home purchases). Make sure your mortgage (principal
+ interest + property tax + homeowners insurance) is 25% or less of your
total income.</p>
<h3 id="">Education</h3>
<p>If needed, you can go into debt to pay for your school. But make sure
your total loan amount doesn’t exceed what you expect to earn during
your first year’s salary out of school. You can save a LOT of money by
doing your first few years of school at a community college before
transferring to a university. Pursue scholarships and grants– that’s
free money, and many are not tied to income.</p>
<h3 id="">Vehicle</h3>
<p>Paying for a car in cash is ideal. But if you really need to get a
car loan, you can. Make sure you are buying a modest car (“think
Corolla, not Land Cruiser”). Prioritize buying used cars so someone else
eats the depreciation. And for the loan, the rule is 20/3/8. Pay 20+%
down, take on a loan no longer than 3 years, and don’t let your loan
payments exceed 8% of your income.</p>
<h2 id="">Saving and investing</h2>
<h3 id="">25% can do
wonders for you</h3>
<p>Strive to save/invest 25% of your income each paycheck. 25% is higher
than the traditional 10-15% rate many financial pundits have
traditionally required and far beyond the &lt;5% of the average
American. But you probably won’t have social security to fall back on
and you’re not average. Saving 25%– especially right now when your
dollars are orders of magnitude more powerful than they will be in
another 5, 10, 20 years– will give you immense flexibility down the
road, maybe to even retire 10 or 15 years early!</p>
<p>When you’re just starting out and you have very little income, that
may seem insane. In which case, start by doing what you can. 10%, 15%,
whatever. Make 25% your goal, and work on raising your savings rate each
year. Then, as you get raises through the next several years, dedicate
half of your raise to increasing your savings rate and you’ll hit 25% in
a few years.</p>
<h2
id="">Where
to put that 25%: the Financial Order of Operations
{#where-to-put-that-25%:-the-financial-order-of-operations}</h2>
<p>Remember the order of operations from math class? “Please Excuse My
Dear Aunt Sally” helped you remember to calculate Parentheses,
Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction in that
order and gave you clear instructions for what to do with your next
calculation.</p>
<p>The Financial Order of Operations gives you clear guidelines on what
to do with your next dollar. Every time you get a paycheck, you need to
ask yourself, “what step am I on?” and put at least 25% of your paycheck
toward that step.</p>

<h3 id="">Step 1: Deductibles Covered</h3>
<h4 id="">First, let’s talk about
insurance</h4>
<p>People fear catastrophe. So we all pitch a few dollars into a big
pool of money. The person running the pool takes a cut. And when
catastrophe hits a few of us, they get the money in the pool. The rest
of us get no money, but that’s good because that means catastrophe
didn’t hit us. And we sleep better at night knowing there’s a big pool
of money waiting for us if it does.</p>
<p>That’s insurance– it protects you from some of the major risks of
life. Auto insurance pays for replacement or repair to your car if it
gets wrecked. Homeowners insurance if your house gets wrecked. Health
insurance pays when your body gets wrecked. And life insurance pays your
family if your “stay alive” parts get completely wrecked.</p>
<p>Insurance includes a few different costs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Premiums</strong>: this is what you pay for the privilege of
being in the insurance. It’s like a gym membership or a Spotify
subscription– it doesn’t matter whether you use it or not, you have to
pay for it every month.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Deductible</strong>: This is the amount of your costs that’s
completely on you. For example, if you have a $1,000 deductible,
insurance isn’t going to lift a finger to cover costs until you have
paid $1,000 of your own money to the problem (which is what it means to
“meet your deductible”). Requiring you to put some skin in the game
first means you will be more careful in how you act and spend. Not every
insurance plan has a deductible (this will be important when we talk
about HSAs later).<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Coinsurance:</strong> If you have no deductible (or if
you’ve already met it), the insurance is likely not going to start
covering <em>all</em> your expenses right away. Instead, you will share
the responsibility of paying. Insurance will pay some percentage (50%,
75%, 90%, etc) and you’ll pay the rest.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Copays:</strong> Even when the insurance company is paying
their percentage, they still want you to have more skin in the game and
avoid unnecessary expenses. So they will often require you to pay a flat
amount of each service (like $25 per doctor visit) before they will
start splitting the rest of the cost with you.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Out of pocket maximum:</strong> Finally, a term that is
intuitively named! Once you’ve paid this amount of money in deductibles
and coinsurance and copays, you’re done! Everything for the rest of the
year is free (except your premiums, of course).</li>
</ul>
<p>When you enroll in an insurance plan, you’ll trade off one cost for
another cost. Think of it this way: if you have no insurance, you have
no guaranteed cost every month, but you have a very high possible cost
if something goes wrong. On the other end of the spectrum, you can pay a
ton in guaranteed monthly costs and in exchange the insurance company
will pay almost everything for you. When you are presented with multiple
insurance options, you will need to figure out where you want to be
along that spectrum of risk and responsibility.</p>
<h4 id="">Applying that to step 1</h4>
<p>Between your health, home, and car insurance, what’s the highest
deductible you’d have to pay in those policies if something went wrong?
The first step is to save up that amount in a high-yield savings account
you can access any time. This should give you a little bit of an
emergency cushion so if something goes wrong, you don’t have to go get a
loan.</p>
<h3 id="">Step 2: Employer Match</h3>
<p>At most companies you’ll likely have access to an employer-sponsored
retirement plan. If you do, your employer may offer a match on your
contributions. For example, if you contribute 4% of your income to your
retirement plan, your employer may add another 2% on top of that. This
is <strong>literally free money</strong>, and you’re stupid if you turn
it down. Enroll in at least the bare minimum contribution to your 401k
to get the full employer match. If you have the choice between Roth and
traditional 401k accounts, go with the Roth.<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>If you are enrolled in a high-deductible health plan through your
employer, your employer may also offer a match on your contributions to
an HSA (more on HSAs and health insurance in a minute). Again, that
match is <strong>free money</strong>, and you should get on that right
away!</p>
<h3 id="">Step 3: High-Interest Debt</h3>
<p>Once you’ve built up some breathing room and got your free money,
let’s do a gut-check on your spending. If you didn’t follow the debt
advice from earlier in the chapter, that’s your next priority. A debt
with an interest rate &gt; 8-10% is going to hurt you more than an
investment is going to help you.</p>
<p>If it feels depressing to spend so much on debt, think of it this
way: paying off a $1,000 balance on a 20% credit card has the same
effect on your overall net worth as investing $1,000 in an account
earning 20%– which is far above any return you’ll see in the market in a
normal year. So every dollar you spend on step 3 is FAR more powerful
than the dollars you’ll be investing later. Fight through it!</p>
<h3 id="">Step 4: Emergency Reserves</h3>
<p>You started your emergency fund in step 1 to give yourself a little
bit of breathing room. And now that you’re not in danger from debt, you
can shift your attention and expand that “breathing room” into a runway
you can use to launch forward into <em>growth</em>. Save up enough money
in your emergency fund to cover 3-6 months of your normal living
expenses. So if you lose your job or unexpectedly have to replace your
car, you’re not back to square one.</p>
<h3 id="">Step 5: Roth &amp; HSA</h3>
<p>Now we’re ready to finally get serious about investing for your
future! We’ll start with your HSA and Roth accounts:</p>
<h4 id="">HSA: your most powerful
account</h4>
<p>When you choose a health insurance plan, I strongly urge you to
consider a “high-deductitble” health plan, especially when you’re young
and healthy. A high-deductible plan is simply a health plan with a
deductible high enough that it meets the IRS definition of “high” (at
the time of this writing, that’s $1,650 for individuals and $3,300 for
families). Having a high-deductible plan gives you many benefits:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Lower premiums<br />
</li>
<li>“Skin in the game” encouraging you to comparison-shop and reduce
your health costs<br />
</li>
<li>It makes you eligible for a Health Savings Account (HSA).</li>
</ol>
<p>That last one is key. An HSA is the most powerful account type in
your arsenal for saving for the future because not only will many
employers match your contributions (see step 2), but HSAs are triple–
sometimes even <em>quadruple</em> tax-advantaged! What does that
mean?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If it’s an employer-sponsored HSA, you can likely tell your employer
to take your contributions directly out of your paycheck. This
contribution comes out before payroll (social security and medicare)
taxes.<br />
</li>
<li>Any amount you contribute is also exempt from your income
taxes<br />
</li>
<li>The contributions and the growth of the account over time grows
tax-free<br />
</li>
<li>And you can withdraw them tax-free!</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, unlike HSA’s disappointing cousin (the FSA), the money
in your HSA is yours forever– there is no “use it or lose it” rule at
the end of the year. You can keep using your HSA funds for the rest of
your life, no matter what health plan you have at the time!</p>
