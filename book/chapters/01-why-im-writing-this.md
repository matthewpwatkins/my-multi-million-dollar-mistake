# Why I'm Writing This {#why-i'm-writing-this}

I served a 2-year full-time mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints right after high school. I returned at 21 years old, married my wife a few months later, and together we started in the world of "adulting."

Financially, I thought I had it all figured out. My wife and I had both been taught about the dangers of debt and excessive consumption. We had worked hard before we married, and were blessed to start married life with a few thousand dollars in the bank!

We lived frugally, squeezing every penny. We did all the *hard* work to create financial success. But we didn't do the *easy* work. And that's where it all went wrong.

When my dad tried to wakeboard for the first time, he just couldn't get it. Everyone tried to tell him "when the boat starts going fast enough, just stand up!" But every time he "*just* stood up," he fell ungracefully into the water. He felt embarrassed and defeated. Finally, one of his friends said "Keith, here's the science of what's going on," and explained the physics of *how* wakeboarding works. Once he explained the physics, Dad didn't feel he was blindly following instructions ("*just* stand up"). He was able to wakeboard after that. He could intuit *what* to do because he now understood the *how*.

My brain works the same way. My risk-averse, analytical mind needed the same explanation for finance that my dad received for wakeboarding. None of this "*just* open a Roth IRA" stuff. I needed someone to explain "here's how the financial world works and *why* this is the right way."

I wish I could go back in time and have a 3-hour visit with my 21-year old self and teach him what I'm writing here. That 3-hour discussion would have changed my entire financial life. The *level of effort* I would have expended through that first decade  would have been exactly the same. But simply changing the *direction* of that effort would have put me hundreds of thousands of dollars ahead of where I'm at now (2025) and will have made *several million dollars* of difference by the time I retire. That's no typo. **One three-hour discussion would have saved me several million dollars by the time I retire.**

I'm writing this because I know many young adults are like me. They want to succeed financially, and they understand the basics of avoiding debt, but they were never taught the principles of wealth-building. They don't know the *incredible* opportunities staring them in the face. And by the time they learn these lessons in their 30s or 40s, they, like me, will have missed out on the multi-million dollar opportunities that were available only in their twenties.
