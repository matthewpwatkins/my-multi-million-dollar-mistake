# Chapter 1: The eighth wonder of the world {#chapter-1:-the-eighth-wonder-of-the-world}

## The rich uncle {#the-rich-uncle}

Let's play a game and see how human intuition plays out. Suppose a rich uncle leaves you and your brother an inheritance in his will. His estate will create a simple checking account for you and contribute money into it every day for the next 4 years, after which, the money in the account is yours. You can choose two different ways to earn:

**The $100/day plan:** Very simple. His estate deposits $100 into your account every day for the next 4 years.

**The 1% plan:** Your account gets one dollar to start. Then his estate increases the account value by 1% every day for the next 4 years.

The answer seems pretty clear: $100 per day for free, that's *awesome*! You and your brother both sign up. But to your horror, you get too excited and accidentally sign up for the 1% plan!

You're understandably bummed. Intuitively, this doesn't sound terribly exciting. 1% of your dollar is just a penny. Earn a penny a day for four years, and you'll have earned a whopping $14.61 in interest. Meanwhile, your friends in Account B will have earned $146,100 during those four years!

You're feeling pretty bitter about this, so you track your account balance over time so you can quantify just how much that mistaken button click will cost you. Looking at the first two weeks, your depression is completely justified:

| Day | The 1% plan balance | The $100 plan balance |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | $1.01 | $100 |
| 2 | $1.02 | $200 |
| 3 | $1.03 | $300 |
| 4 | $1.04 | $400 |
| 5 | $1.05 | $500 |
| 6 | $1.06 | $600 |
| 7 | $1.07 | $700 |
| 8 | $1.08 | $800 |
| 9 | $1.09 | $900 |
| 10 | $1.10 | $1,000 |
| 11 | $1.12 | $1,100 |
| 12 | $1.13 | $1,200 |
| 13 | $1.14 | $1,300 |
| 14 | $1.15 | $1,400 |

As expected, you receive a penny into your account each day while your brother is raking in *10,000x* that much every day. But I'll point you to Day 11 where you'll see something weird there-- you got an extra cent on that day-- a *whole extra cent*! That extra penny is why I'm so excited for you choosing the 1% plan.

*"So, I get an extra penny every week or two? So I won't earn $13 over four years, maybe I'll earn $16 or something? Not exactly a great consolation prize."*

Look, I get this example underwhelming so far. But I want to show you the power behind that extra penny. This tiny little example is your first introduction to the eighth wonder of the world: *compound growth*. That's when the interest you earned earlier multiplies and creates its own interest on top of itself. It's like your money is having babies!

Still not convinced? I get it. Let's give it some time and check back after a month:

| Day | The 1% plan balance | The $100 plan balance |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 30 | $1.34 | $3,000.00 |

Okay, so another *three* "extra pennies" were added during the final two weeks of the month. That's nice, but you still don't even have enough to buy a Costco hotdog. Meanwhile while your insufferable brother is apparently earning enough to pay his mortgage, and with cash to spare!

Let's check back after about 3 months:

| Day | The 1% plan balance | The $100 plan balance |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 90 | $2.44 | $9,000.00 |

In the past *90* days, you got *144* pennies-- that's *54 extra pennies!* It's encouraging to see a little increase in the frequency of our "extra penny" phenomenon. But it doesn't change the vast overwhelm. Here we are 3 months out and you can't even buy a value menu burger from McDonalds. But your brother can now buy a decent used car.

You're getting really depressed. Let's stop obsessing over this and check back at the end of the year:

| Day | The 1% plan balance | The $100 plan balance |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 365 (1 year) | $37.78 | $36,500.00 |

Well it's been a long year. Has your account blossomed into something cool? Well, I think so! You expected a penny per day-- a little over $4.00 by this point, but you have almost $40! Those extra pennies are coming in all the time now, not just every several days. Isn't that exciting?

*"No, my brother has enough for a down payment on a new house, while I still can't even afford to take a date to get some decent Mexican food!"*

Understood. Let's take a break for another year and check back then.

| Day | The 1% plan balance | The $100 plan balance |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 730 (2 years) | $1,427.59 | $73,000.00 |

Huh, that's different! You had less than $40 after a year, you might have expected $80 or so after 2 years-- maybe a little more from those "extra pennies." But your account balance is now *18 times* that! If you look at the day by day balance changes, you'll find that you're not earning an occasional extra penny anymore-- now you're earning a solid $12+ dollars *per day*. Cool!

*"Yeah but $12/day is nothing compared to $100/day. We're already halfway through the 4 years and my brother is WAY ahead and I'm still earning nowhere close to him. He's getting rich and there's no way I'll come close to catching up! Maybe he'll have pity on me and invite me on his nice vacation. Well, at least maybe I see it's starting to grow fast. Who knows, maybe it will grow to $5,000 by the time this is done. Do I dare hope to see ten?"*

Okay, okay, let's check again after year 3.

| Day | The 1% plan balance | The $100 plan balance |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1,095 (3 years) | $53,939.17 | $109,500.00 |

Well your brother has crossed into six figures, and he's gleefully telling you all the things he's going to do now that he's "wealthy." You were maybe afraid to look at your own balance. You're starting to realize this interest rate thing is weird, so you don't know what to expect last year's $1,400 grew into.

You open your account and you're shocked to see you are almost halfway to your brother's account balance. Your days of me celebrating an extra penny every few weeks feel like just yesterday, but it looks like if you're lucky you might just come close to catching up to your brother after all! Hopeful, you close your laptop and check back at the end of the experiment.

As expected, your brother closed his journey with his $146,000 and "generously" invited you to join him on his vacation to Cancun. You check on your account to see how far behind you are. Maybe, if you're not *too* far behind, you'll surprise him by offering to contribute to the cost.

| Day | The 1% plan balance | The $100 plan balance |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1,461 (4 years) | $2,058,387.31 | $146,100.00 |

Your mouth drops. No, that can't be right. *Over 2 million dollars?* There must be some mistake.

But there isn't. Your little $1 account that earned "an extra penny" every few weeks at the beginning is now earning almost ***$21,000 every single day***. Maybe you should *buy* a property in Cancun and offer to let your poor brother stay there? ðŸ˜‰

## What happened? {#what-happened?}

How in the world did you end up with more than 2 million dollars? Well, for the first two years, your initial gut instinct was 100% right-- the $100/day linear approach (red) far outperforms the 1% approach (green):

![Compound interest: linear vs exponential](images/compound-interest-linear-vs-exponential.png)

But sometime shortly into year three, the lines swap places and your previously laughable 1% per day account absolutely destroys your brother's account:

![Compound interest crossover point](images/compound-interest-crossover.png)

So here's lesson #1: humans think *linearly*, but compound interest works *exponentially*. It doesn't matter how often I run these simulations, it doesn't matter how often I do the math, this fact constantly surprises and delights me. It never really becomes intuitive-- that's why it's the eighth wonder of the world.

Now, you're not going to find any bank that will offer you a 1% per day interest rate (if you do, let me know, because I wouldn't mind becoming a trillionaire ðŸ˜‰). This is just an example to illustrate the power of compound interest:

No matter what the interest rate, no matter what the initial amount, *any* interest rate will exponentially outperform *any* linear graph *if you give it enough time*.

## Calculating compound growth {#calculating-compound-growth}

As I said earlier, compound growth is hard for us humans to naturally intuit because our brains can't help but think linearly, so we need math. There is a formula you can use to calculate the value of a number if it grows at a certain percentage rate:

Final value = Starting value * ((1 + interest rate)number of times compounded)

Let's apply that to the 1% per day example from earlier. We represent the 1% = .01 as a decimal, and plug in 1,461 (the number of days in 4 years)

Final value = $1.00 * (1 + .01)1461

If you plug that into your calculator, you'll see that beautiful $2+ million number from before.

But of course real banks and investments don't pay 1% per day. Let's try a realistic example.

The S&P 500 is an index that tracks the stock values of the largest 500 public companies in the US. It's a decent indicator of the overall US stock market, and has historically increased at an average of 10% per year. Let's see how $1,000 would do on average across 1 year, 5 years, 10 year, and 25 years, compounded annually:

| Time | Formula | Result |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Stating amount |  | $1,000 |
| 1 year | $1,000 * 1.1**1** | $1,100 |
| 2 years | $1,000 * 1.1**2** | $1,210 |
| 5 years | $1,000 * 1.1**5** | $1,610 |
| 10 years | $1,000 * 1.1**10** | $2,594 |
| 25 years | $1,000 * 1.1**25** | $10,835 |

## Estimating compound growth {#estimating-compound-growth}

You'll notice in the example above that between years 5 and 10 we passed an interesting milestone--- we *doubled* the initial amount. Specifically, we reached the doubling point for a 10% return after about 7 years, 3 months. Try plugging in different starting amounts-- it doesn't matter-- at a 10% rate of return, you'll always have double whatever you started with after about 7 years, 3 months.

If you try with a 9% rate of return, you'll find that doubling takes a little longer at 8 years.  
If you try with an 8% rate of return, it takes even longer, doubling after 9 years.  
And if you try with a 1% interest rate, it doubles after about 72 years.

Do you see the pattern between the rate of return and the time in which your investment first doubles? Congratulations, you just discovered the famous "rule of 72." Whenever someone tells you a yearly rate of return, just divide 72 by that number and the answer tells you about how many years it will take for that interest rate to double the amount you put in.

72 / 6 is 12. So a 6% interest rate will double its value every 12 years.  
72 / 4 is 18. So a 4% interest rate will double its value every 18 years.

So, without using your calculator, can you estimate how much you'd have if you put $1,000 into an account earning 10% yearly after 29 years?

72 / 10 = 7.2, meaning the account doubles every 7.2 years. We know 7 goes into 28 four times. And the 0.2s added four times on top give us an extra one to arrive at about 29. So we can expect the amount will double 4 times over the 29 years. So we should see the amount go from $1,000 to $2,000 over the first seven years, from $2,000 to $4,000 during the second seven years, from $4,000 to $8,000 over the third seven years, and from $8,000 to $16,000 over the fourth seven years.
