# How You Can Get Started {#how-you-can-get-started}

I've tried to collect the "big ideas" together and help you understand the *amazing* potential your dollars have if you start early. I hope this lit a fire under you to hit the ground running. Your most powerful year to shape your financial future is the year you first get started. Don't lose out.

But you'll need more than just big ideas about compound interest and the wealth multiplier. You need to know how to choose an affordable brokerage, how to prioritize emergency savings, what types of accounts to use to minimize your tax burden, and so much more.

Your best friend in this journey is going to be the book [Millionaire Mission by Brian Preston](https://moneyguy.com/millionairemission/). He covers the big principles I talked about here in much greater detail. But he also outlines a 9-step "order of operations" for your personal financial life so you always know the most efficient thing to do with your next dollar in each stage of life. He also gives you great rules of thumb around mortgage, car, and school loans, Roth v traditional retirement accounts, and many other important guides. No gimmicks, no sales pitches, nothing fancy or risky. You aren't trying to beat the market-- just *ride* the market in the safest, most tax-efficient way possible.

The next resource would be Brian's show, [The Money Guy Show](https://moneyguy.com/) on YouTube or podcasts. His website also has a ton of free resources like the wealth multiplier calculator, a net worth tool, and other great stuff. He also has a few paid video courses to calculate your retirement number, learn the financial order of operations, and much more that are well worth it in my opinion.

If you're new to this world, some parts of his show itself will seem confusing at first. Just like how the Latter-day Saint culture and vocabulary is overwhelming to a new convert at first. Read or listen to the book first, and then stuff in the show will make more sense. Immerse yourself in it, and you'll start picking it up faster than you would have thought.

The next resource would be [the Clark Howard show](https://clark.com). He is less focused on big picture financial planning concepts and more the day to day application of wise financial principles and squeezing the best out of every dollar. He's got great information on everything from how to get the best cell phone plan for your needs, how to save on airfare, the best way to maximize your credit card rewards, and so much more. He speaks slowly, so listen to his podcast on 1.5x speed!
