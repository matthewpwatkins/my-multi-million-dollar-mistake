# Chapter 2: Your Financial Success Plan {#chapter-2:-your-financial-success-plan}

We've talked about the big ideas, now let's start getting into the specifics. I'll keep each section as brief as possible.

## Optimize your spending {#optimize-your-spending}

### Live within your means (obviously) {#live-within-your-means-(obviously)}

This is the hard part-- the part I actually did! Spend less than you make and follow a budget. If you're like me, having software to categorize your expenses and track how you're doing is a must-have. But whether you like to go the pen-and-paper route, a spreadsheet, etc, it doesn't matter. Just remember: every dollar is a soldier in your army. If you aren't keeping track of where your soldiers are and what they're doing, you're not getting the value you need out of them.

### Use credit cards (but don't let them use you) {#use-credit-cards-(but-don't-let-them-use-you)}

Credit cards give you consumer protections you don't get with a debit card. Plus, many offer rewards (like 2%+ cash back). Choose 2-3 credit cards that will give you the best rewards for your expenses ([here's a good guide on choosing the best cards](https://clark.com/credit-cards/)) and set them up to auto-pay in full every month. Credit card *debt*, we hate; credit card *use* is great!

### Stretch your dollars {#stretch-your-dollars}

My cell phone plan costs a quarter of the plan my friends have, and I'm on the same network as them. The cereal my kids eat costs half of their friends' cereal and tastes just as good. Our family spends half the amount as other families on the same medicines. And we spend far less than the average family in our area on groceries.

How do we do this? By taking a little bit of time to research. I use an MVNO carrier for my phone plan instead of AT&T, T-Mobile, or Verizon. We shop at Walmart, Aldi, and Sam's Club instead of Publix or Target or Trader Joes. We buy store brand instead of name brand. We unit price instead of blinding grabbing the first item on the shelves. We compare prescription prices across pharmacies.

It's amazing how much further you can make your dollars go when you are willing to go against the stream, find out what providers are out there others may not be aware of, and compare your options.

The best general resource I've found for learning how to save money across the many aspects of your life is [Clark Howard](https://clark.com/). His website (and daily show) will help you save money on everything from health to cell phones to streaming to groceries to travel. Many people and families can easily save 20+% on their daily spending.

## Debt: a powerful, deadly tool {#debt:-a-powerful,-deadly-tool}

Debt is like a chainsaw. If you're careful, you can do awesome things like clear acres of wilderness. If you're not careful, you can clear your head from your body. A good rule of thumb: never take on debt except for the following:

### Mortgage {#mortgage}

You likely won't afford to buy a house in cash. But your first house should be modest. Make sure to put at least 5% down on your first house (20%+ down on future home purchases). Make sure your mortgage (principal + interest + property tax + homeowners insurance) is 25% or less of your total income.

### Education {#education}

If needed, you can go into debt to pay for your school. But make sure your total loan amount doesn't exceed what you expect to earn during your first year's salary out of school. You can save a LOT of money by doing your first few years of school at a community college before transferring to a university. Pursue scholarships and grants-- that's free money, and many are not tied to income.

### Vehicle {#vehicle}

Paying for a car in cash is ideal. But if you really need to get a car loan, you can. Make sure you are buying a modest car ("think Corolla, not Land Cruiser"). Prioritize buying used cars so someone else eats the depreciation. And for the loan, the rule is 20/3/8. Pay 20+% down, take on a loan no longer than 3 years, and don't let your loan payments exceed 8% of your income.

## Saving and investing {#saving-and-investing}

### 25% can do wonders for you {#25%-can-do-wonders-for-you}

Strive to save/invest 25% of your income each paycheck. 25% is higher than the traditional 10-15% rate many financial pundits have traditionally required and far beyond the <5% of the average American. But you probably won't have social security to fall back on and you're not average. Saving 25%-- especially right now when your dollars are orders of magnitude more powerful than they will be in another 5, 10, 20 years-- will give you immense flexibility down the road, maybe to even retire 10 or 15 years early!

When you're just starting out and you have very little income, that may seem insane. In which case, start by doing what you can. 10%, 15%, whatever. Make 25% your goal, and work on raising your savings rate each year. Then, as you get raises through the next several years, dedicate half of your raise to increasing your savings rate and you'll hit 25% in a few years.

## Where to put that 25%: the Financial Order of Operations {#where-to-put-that-25%:-the-financial-order-of-operations}

Remember the order of operations from math class? "Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally" helped you remember to calculate Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction in that order and gave you clear instructions for what to do with your next calculation.

The Financial Order of Operations gives you clear guidelines on what to do with your next dollar. Every time you get a paycheck, you need to ask yourself, "what step am I on?" and put at least 25% of your paycheck toward that step.

### Step 1: Deductibles Covered {#step-1:-deductibles-covered}

#### First, let's talk about insurance

People fear catastrophe. So we all pitch a few dollars into a big pool of money. The person running the pool takes a cut. And when catastrophe hits a few of us, they get the money in the pool. The rest of us get no money, but that's good because that means catastrophe didn't hit us. And we sleep better at night knowing there's a big pool of money waiting for us if it does.

That's insurance-- it protects you from some of the major risks of life. Auto insurance pays for replacement or repair to your car if it gets wrecked. Homeowners insurance if your house gets wrecked. Health insurance pays when your body gets wrecked. And life insurance pays your family if your "stay alive" parts get completely wrecked.

Insurance includes a few different costs:

* **Premiums**: this is what you pay for the privilege of being in the insurance. It's like a gym membership or a Spotify subscription-- it doesn't matter whether you use it or not, you have to pay for it every month.  
* **Deductible**: This is the amount of your costs that's completely on you. For example, if you have a $1,000 deductible, insurance isn't going to lift a finger to cover costs until you have paid $1,000 of your own money to the problem (which is what it means to "meet your deductible"). Requiring you to put some skin in the game first means you will be more careful in how you act and spend. Not every insurance plan has a deductible (this will be important when we talk about HSAs later).  
* **Coinsurance:** If you have no deductible (or if you've already met it), the insurance is likely not going to start covering *all* your expenses right away. Instead, you will share the responsibility of paying. Insurance will pay some percentage (50%, 75%, 90%, etc) and you'll pay the rest.  
* **Copays:** Even when the insurance company is paying their percentage, they still want you to have more skin in the game and avoid unnecessary expenses. So they will often require you to pay a flat amount of each service (like $25 per doctor visit) before they will start splitting the rest of the cost with you.  
* **Out of pocket maximum:** Finally, a term that is intuitively named! Once you've paid this amount of money in deductibles and coinsurance and copays, you're done! Everything for the rest of the year is free (except your premiums, of course).

When you enroll in an insurance plan, you'll trade off one cost for another cost. Think of it this way: if you have no insurance, you have no guaranteed cost every month, but you have a very high possible cost if something goes wrong. On the other end of the spectrum, you can pay a ton in guaranteed monthly costs and in exchange the insurance company will pay almost everything for you. When you are presented with multiple insurance options, you will need to figure out where you want to be along that spectrum of risk and responsibility.

#### Applying that to step 1

Between your health, home, and car insurance, what's the highest deductible you'd have to pay in those policies if something went wrong? The first step is to save up that amount in a high-yield savings account you can access any time. This should give you a little bit of an emergency cushion so if something goes wrong, you don't have to go get a loan.

### Step 2: Employer Match {#step-2:-employer-match}

At most companies you'll likely have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan. If you do, your employer may offer a match on your contributions. For example, if you contribute 4% of your income to your retirement plan, your employer may add another 2% on top of that. This is **literally free money**, and you're stupid if you turn it down. Enroll in at least the bare minimum contribution to your 401k to get the full employer match. If you have the choice between Roth and traditional 401k accounts, go with the Roth.[^2]

If you are enrolled in a high-deductible health plan through your employer, your employer may also offer a match on your contributions to an HSA (more on HSAs and health insurance in a minute). Again, that match is **free money**, and you should get on that right away!

### Step 3: High-Interest Debt {#step-3:-high-interest-debt}

Once you've built up some breathing room and got your free money, let's do a gut-check on your spending. If you didn't follow the debt advice from earlier in the chapter, that's your next priority. A debt with an interest rate > 8-10% is going to hurt you more than an investment is going to help you.

If it feels depressing to spend so much on debt, think of it this way: paying off a $1,000 balance on a 20% credit card has the same effect on your overall net worth as investing $1,000 in an account earning 20%-- which is far above any return you'll see in the market in a normal year. So every dollar you spend on step 3 is FAR more powerful than the dollars you'll be investing later. Fight through it!

### Step 4: Emergency Reserves

You started your emergency fund in step 1 to give yourself a little bit of breathing room. And now that you're not in danger from debt, you can shift your attention and expand that "breathing room" into a runway you can use to launch forward into *growth*. Save up enough money in your emergency fund to cover 3-6 months of your normal living expenses. So if you lose your job or unexpectedly have to replace your car, you're not back to square one.

### Step 5: Roth & HSA

Now we're ready to finally get serious about investing for your future! We'll start with your HSA and Roth accounts:

#### HSA: your most powerful account

When you choose a health insurance plan, I strongly urge you to consider a "high-deductitble" health plan, especially when you're young and healthy. A high-deductible plan is simply a health plan with a deductible high enough that it meets the IRS definition of "high" (at the time of this writing, that's $1,650 for individuals and $3,300 for families). Having a high-deductible plan gives you many benefits:

1. Lower premiums  
2. "Skin in the game" encouraging you to comparison-shop and reduce your health costs  
3. It makes you eligible for a Health Savings Account (HSA).

That last one is key. An HSA is the most powerful account type in your arsenal for saving for the future because not only will many employers match your contributions (see step 2), but HSAs are triple-- sometimes even *quadruple* tax-advantaged! What does that mean?

1. If it's an employer-sponsored HSA, you can likely tell your employer to take your contributions directly out of your paycheck. This contribution comes out before payroll (social security and medicare) taxes.  
2. Any amount you contribute is also exempt from your income taxes  
3. The contributions and the growth of the account over time grows tax-free  
4. And you can withdraw them tax-free!

Additionally, unlike HSA's disappointing cousin (the FSA), the money in your HSA is yours forever-- there is no "use it or lose it" rule at the end of the year. You can keep using your HSA funds for the rest of your life, no matter what health plan you have at the time!
